# modemResetter
## What it does:
Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 feather periodically checks for an internet connection, if it cannot connect it fires a relay. My cable modem is connected to the NC terminals of the relay so the gizmo will reset the modem when there is no connection. Also using a datalogger wing to log reset events.

#### Note:
The code is rough but servicable. Since I've had my cable company fix the problem, I probably won't be doing much with this anymore.
